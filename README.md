===========

This Github contains 'SpecSeg', an open source calcium imaging processing toolbox to detect regions of interest (ROIs) in calcium imaging datasets.
ROI segmentation is based on cross-spectral power over a range of frequencies and has been tested and optimized for a variety of neuronal compartments
(cell bodies, dendrites, axons) and (imaging) techniques (chronic glass windows, GRIN lenses, 1P, 2P). 
The SpecSeg toolbox contains user-friendly graphical interfaces to detect, adjust ROIs and visualize their activity traces.
This pipeline includes code adapted from [normcorre](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/NoRMCorre) ([Pnevmatikakis & Giovannucci 2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jneumeth.2017.07.031)),
 to apply motion correction to sbx files. To be able to execute the motion correction, download the code from 
 [NoRMCorre](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/NoRMCorre) and add the code into the matlab path below SpectralSegmentation.<br /> 
Spike estimation can be done on the fluorescence traces, with code that uses [*MLspike*](https://github.com/MLspike/spikes) ([Deneux et al. 2016](https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms12190)). 
MLspike requires the [brick](https://github.com/MLspike/brick) toolbox. Add MLspike and brick folders to the Matlab path.<br />
This is the pipeline that is used by the Leveltlab in the Netherlands Institute of Neuroscience (NIN).<br /><br />
The pipeline is easily executable manually per step with the script [SpectralPipeline](https://github.com/Leveltlab/SpectralSegmentation/blob/master/SpectralPipeline.m).<br />
Or via the script that runs the pipeline automatically for as many files as requested [AutomatedPipeline](https://github.com/Leveltlab/SpectralSegmentation/blob/master/AutomatedAnalysis.m), until RoiManagerGUI which requires manual input.<br />

Why use the spectral segmentation toolbox
===========
- User-friendly.
- Automatic ROI detection, with a user interface for a-priori selection of properties such as ROI size, minimum roundness, minimum signal correlation, etc.
- Powerful ROI editor. Create new ROIs, split existing ROIs, delete ROIs manually or based on properties like size, roundness and spectral power.
Visualize and explore the fluorescence data in many ways.
- Designed for and tested on a range of techniques and neuronal compartments 
(cell bodies, dendrites, axons, 1P, 2P, chronic glass windows, chronic GRIN lenses, cortical and subcortical brain regions)
- To increase speed and decrease memory load fluorescence data is transposed and memory mapped.
- Some scripts increase speed by using parallel processing.
- The cross-spectral power images that result from the spectral analysis show excellent separation of active neural elements from the background. 
The cross-spectral power has the advantage over correlation in the time domain of the fluorescence signal in that it has power over multiple different frequencies. 
Different frequencies contain different signal sources; noise can be visible in some frequencies, while neurons can be visible in others (see figure below).
- Chronic tracking of ROIs over multiple sessions (imaged days to months apart).

This image shows results of the spectral analysis on two-photon calcium imaging in mouse V1.
The average- and maximum fluorescence can show fluorescence that is not related to activity of neurons. For example,
 higher baseline fluorescence of a neuron that is not clearly active (cyan box, with its signal shown on the right), or lower baseline 
 fluorescence in blood vessels (green box). However, the cross-spectral power images shows different active neurons, depending on the frequency.
 The red box indicates a neuron that was not visible in the average- and maximum fluorescence projection, but it is clearly visible in some of the cross-spectral power images.
 Therefore, these cross-spectral power images are very useful for ROI selection.


Installation
======
The SpecSeg pipeline only requires MATLAB to be able run on most operating systems.
1. Download the SpecSeg code from this Github.
2. To be able to use motion correction, download [NoRMCorre](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/NoRMCorre).
3. To be able to do spike estimation on ROI signals, download [*MLspike*](https://github.com/MLspike/spikes) and [brick](https://github.com/MLspike/brick).
4. In MATLAB, add the folders from these repositories to your MATLAB path.

    Transposing datasets (StackTranspose.m) works via a MATLAB mex function.
     The mex function is compiled in MATLAB from the C++ code [Zorder.cpp](https://github.com/Leveltlab/SpectralSegmentation/blob/master/spectral/dep/Zorder.cpp).
     For Windows 64-bit, and Mac 64-bit Zorder is compiled and should work automatically.
    However, for other operating systems it needs to be compiled for your system in MATLAB.<br />
5. (if necessary). Compile Zorder.cpp by setting MATLAB's current directory to SpectralSegmentation/Spectral/Dep and executing: *mex Zorder.cpp*
For this to work a compiler must be installed in MATLAB, get information on that by executing *mex -setup* in MATLAB.
To find a suitable compiler go to: https://www.mathworks.com/support/compilers.
If you get the C++ compiler by installing Visual Studio, make sure to install:
 [*Desktop Development with C++*](https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/answers/443349-how-do-i-install-visual-studio-2017-or-2019-for-use-with-matlab-simulink).
